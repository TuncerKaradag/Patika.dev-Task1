    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>First of all welcome to my first web page. I am a student at Anadolu University in Turkey. My branch is Media and Press but I love coding. When I was a child I was thinking about the Computer "box" also I was wondering what is going on inside the box. One day I made a big mistake... I opened. That's how ı met the computer at all. Since that day I want to be the person who is part of computer science. But my bad math tasks failed me in that path. And today, I want to combine coding with the media knowledge I have learned.</p>
